# HeadFirstDesignPatternHead First Design Pattern: my notes taken from the book and exercises that I practiced.---Table of contents==========={:toc}## 1 Strategy Pattern### 1 StrategyStrategy defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.### 2 Shared languagePatterns provide a shared language that can maximize the value of your communication with other developers.## 2 Observer Pattern### Design Principles* Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.  * The thing that varies in the Observer Pattern is the state of the Subject and the number and types of Observers. With this pattern, you can vary the objects that are dependent on the state of the Subject, without having to change that Subject. That's called planning ahead.* Program to an interface, not an implementation. * Both the Subject and Observer use interfaces. The Subject keeps track of objects implementing the Observer interface, while the observers register with and get notified by, the Subject interface. This keeps things nice and loosely coupled.* Favor composition over inheritance. * The Observer Pattern uses composition to compose any number of Observers with their Subjects. These relationships aren't set up by some kind of inheritance hierarchy. No, they are set up at runtime by composition.## 3 Factory Pattern### The Factory Method Pattern*The Factory Method Pattern* defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.### Design Principle* *Dependency Inversion Principle*: Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.### The Abstract Factory Pattern*The Abstract Factory Pattern* provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
